  /**
   * The animation classNames applied to the component as it appears, enters,
   * exits or has finished the transition. A single name can be provided, which
   * will be suffixed for each stage, e.g. `classNames="fade"` applies:
   *
   * - `fade-appear`, `fade-appear-active`, `fade-appear-done`
   * - `fade-enter`, `fade-enter-active`, `fade-enter-done`
   * - `fade-exit`, `fade-exit-active`, `fade-exit-done`
   *
   * A few details to note about how these classes are applied:
   *
   * 1. They are _joined_ with the ones that are already defined on the child
   *    component, so if you want to add some base styles, you can use
   *    `className` without worrying that it will be overridden.
   *
   * 2. If the transition component mounts with `in={false}`, no classes are
   *    applied yet. You might be expecting `*-exit-done`, but if you think
   *    about it, a component cannot finish exiting if it hasn't entered yet.
   *
   * 2. `fade-appear-done` and `fade-enter-done` will _both_ be applied. This
   *    allows you to define different behavior for when appearing is done and
   *    when regular entering is done, using selectors like
   *    `.fade-enter-done:not(.fade-appear-done)`. For example, you could apply
   *    an epic entrance animation when element first appears in the DOM using
   *    [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/). Otherwise you can
   *    simply use `fade-enter-done` for defining both cases.
   *
   * Each individual classNames can also be specified independently like:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{
   *  appear: 'my-appear',
   *  appearActive: 'my-active-appear',
   *  appearDone: 'my-done-appear',
   *  enter: 'my-enter',
   *  enterActive: 'my-active-enter',
   *  enterDone: 'my-done-enter',
   *  exit: 'my-exit',
   *  exitActive: 'my-active-exit',
   *  exitDone: 'my-done-exit',
   * }}
   * ```
   *
   * If you want to set these classes using CSS Modules:
   *
   * ```js
   * import styles from './styles.css';
   * ```
   *
   * you might want to use camelCase in your CSS file, that way could simply
   * spread them instead of listing them one by one:
   *
   * ```js
   * classNames={{ ...styles }}
   * ```
