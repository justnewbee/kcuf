kcuF
===

a tool for testing ui components, which fucks things up and give detail of the fucked-up stuff

# what is kcuF

"kcuF" (pronounced k-kuf), is the reverse of the word "Fuck".
the reason i used "kcuF" is because i like using "fuck" when testing code in the browser, but i don't want to make it too obvious for a project name.

the main concept is to make each testing of a ui component atomic, you need to test that something, you test only that thing.

## about this version

this version was written a long time (about 2 years+) ago, it was originally for testing ui components written based on jQuery.
the functionality is very simple and basic, there're bugs, defects and unimplemented features, but it is the first usable version.
i will change the way it works, and i will change the code structure, so i decide to push it into github.

in the new version, i'm using LESS as the css preprocessor for ease of theming, and will change the style to a modern flat view, will add in iconfont from icomoon.

see u later...
